**Warning:** This project is at a very early stage. Treat it as an experiment, and understand that breaking changes will be made without warning. The sky may also fall on your head. Using RESTful WP-CLI requires the latest nightly build of [WP-CLI](http://wp-cli.org/), which you can install with `wp cli update --nightly`.

Initial development was [backed by a Kickstarter project](https://wp-cli.org/restful/). This project will evolve alongside the WP REST API's evolution in WordPress core.
